//! # sg — simgit CLI
//!
//! A command-line tool for native copy-on-write Git worktrees. `sg worktree`
//! creates real linked worktrees whose unchanged extents share an immutable
//! baseline via filesystem CoW (APFS `clonefile` / Linux reflink), falling back
//! to an ordinary `git checkout` when the filesystem can't clone.
//!
//! It has no daemon and no server: Git owns the refs, the filesystem owns the
//! data. Agents work in separate Git worktrees in parallel and integrate through
//! normal Git merges.
//!
//! ## Commands
//!
//! - `sg worktree add <branch>` — create a CoW linked worktree (`--ephemeral`
//!   marks it for automatic `gc`, `--json` for machine-readable output)
//! - `sg worktree list` — list worktrees
//! - `sg worktree remove <branch|path>` — remove a worktree (optionally
//!   committing first)
//! - `sg worktree run <branch> -- <command>` — create an ephemeral worktree and
//!   launch a command inside it
//! - `sg worktree gc` — reap idle/ephemeral worktrees and optionally branches
//! - `sg worktree repair` — remount interrupted Linux overlay worktrees
//! - `sg worktree prune` — prune stale worktree administrative entries
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```bash
//! # Create a linked worktree and cd into it
//! cd "$(sg worktree add feature-1)"
//!
//! git add <files>
//! git commit -m "feature work"
//!
//! sg worktree remove --commit   # commit and remove
//! ```
